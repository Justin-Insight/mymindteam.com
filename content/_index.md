      answer: >-
        Yes! All learners can benefit from the transformative learning

        official diagnosis.
    - question: What does neurodivergent mean?
      answer: >-
        A neurodivergent individual is someone whose brain functions differently
        from typical individuals. This can affect one’s attention span, decision
        making, problem solving and many other cognitive functions that affect
        learning and life in general.  



        ADHD, autism and dyslexia are all examples of neurodiversity, but it’s
        important to note not all neurodivergent individuals have a diagnosable
        learning disorder.
