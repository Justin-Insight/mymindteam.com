  heading: Frequently asked <span class="underline underline--secondary">questions</span>
  questions:
    - question: Who will I be working with?
      answer: >-
        Your Mind Team clinician will be chosen specifically for your needs from our multidisciplinary team of interventionists, school psychologists and more.
    - question: How long does treatment take?
      answer: >-
        Treatment is a very different experience for every learner, and timing can vary. We’ll work with you to create a custom treatment timeline based on your needs.
    - question: Do I need a referral to get treatment?
      answer: >-
        No. Because treatment services are paid out of pocket, we do not require referrals or official condition diagnoses to schedule Mind Team treatment services.
    - question: Do I need to do Mind Team testing before I get treatment?
      answer: >-
        Ideally, your journey with Mind Team will begin with one of our professional assessments to diagnose applicable conditions and identify other key information that will be extremely beneficial to the treatment process. However, it is not a requirement to get a Mind Team test before starting treatment.
