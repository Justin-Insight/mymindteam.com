        What are executive functions?
    body: >-
        Executive functions (EF) are cognitive/mental skills that deal with three (3) main brain functions: __working memory, flexible thinking__ and __self-control__. 

        These functions allow us to focus, manage our time, organize and prioritize tasks, remember instructions, regulate emotions and more. 

        ### What is executive dysfunction?

        Executive dysfunction is categorized by challenges in executive function skills that interfere with an individual’s functioning. Both children and adults can struggle with executive dysfunction, often a symptom of other neurodivergent conditions such as ADHD, autism and more.

        ### Executive dysfunction symptoms

        Executive dysfunction affects every individual differently. However, you or your child may be struggling with this condition if you:

        *  Have trouble managing your time and frequently arrive late to school, work and other important functions. 
        
        *  Struggle to concentrate or stay focused. 
        
        *  Find it difficult to start tasks, even when you want to. 
        
        *  Struggle to regulate your emotions and/or impulses. 
        
        *  Find it difficult/stressful to organize large projects with multiple tasks and deadlines. 
        
        *  Have trouble staying organized.
