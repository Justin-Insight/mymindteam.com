    Build a <span class="underline

  body: >-
    If your child is struggling with reading, they aren’t alone. In fact, 35% of 4th graders in the US read below the basic level (<a href="https://www.orton-gillingham.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Orton-Gillingham</a>). We’re here to change that. 


    Mind Team reading interventions break down **reading** and **spelling** into smaller, more manageable skills to ensure your child fully understands basic fundamentals in **phonics, vocabulary, fluency** and more, which are then built upon throughout the program.
