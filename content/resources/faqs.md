  questions:
    - question: ADHD
      answer: >-
        a neurodivergent condition that affects many executive functions. An
        inability to concentrate and/or remain still, forgetfulness and poor
        time management are all common symptoms of ADHD.
    - question: Autism
      answer: >-
        a neurodivergent condition that affects sensory processing,
        communication, and other cognitive/behavioral functions.
    - question: Dyscalculia
      answer: >-
        a neurodivergent condition that affects one’s ability to understand and
        perform various math-related functions. Individuals with dyscalculia may
        struggle to read numbers and mathematical symbols (i.e. +, -, x),
        perform math equations and/or understand maps and other spatial layouts.
    - question: Dyslexia
      answer: >-
        a neurodivergent condition that affects one’s ability to understand and
        perform various reading-related functions. Individuals with dyslexia may
        mix up similarly-spelled words (i.e. bot vs. bat), struggle with reading
        and/or have to read sections of text multiple times before understanding
        them.
    - question: Dysgraphia
      answer: >-
        a neurodivergent condition that affects one’s ability to understand and
        perform various writing-related functions. Individuals with dysgraphia
        tend to struggle with physical writing, forming letters and numbers,
        spelling and other fine-motor skills.
    - question: Neurodivergent
      answer: >-
        a mind with neural differences (in comparison to what is considered
        “typical”) that impact various cognitive functions, behaviors and
        emotions. 


        Neurodivergent individuals may experience difficulties communicating,
        learning and thriving in typical home, school and work environments
        because of these neural differences. 


        Diagnosable neurodivergent conditions include autism, ADHD, dyslexia,
        dysgraphia and dyscalculia, all of which we test for and treat here at
        Mind Team. It’s important to note that many neurodivergent individuals
        may not meet the full symptomatic requirements for an official condition
        diagnosis but may still struggle with various cognitive functions, which
        Mind Team treatment can help to support.

  heading: Testing FAQs
  questions:
    - question: How does Mind Team testing work?
      answer: >-
        Our simple, comprehensive testing process starts with a pre-assessment
        intake interview to record your background, history and specific
        concerns. Your clinician will then help you schedule the Mind Team test
        that best fits your needs.


        On your test day, get comfortable wherever you have a private space and
        stable internet connection and complete your face-to-face remote testing
        session with an experienced Mind Team clinician. 


        Once our multidisciplinary team has fully evaluated your assessment and
        confirmed our findings, you’ll attend a final face-to-face virtual
        appointment reviewing your test results, applicable diagnoses and expert
        recommendations and guidance on which steps to take next on your
        learning journey.
    - question: Who will I be working with?
      answer: >-
        You will be matched with a licensed Mind Team clinician whose experience
        and specialty best suits your needs and concerns within our
        multidisciplinary team.
    - question: How long does testing take?
      answer: >-
        It depends. Mind Team assessments are tailored to your unique history,
        background and concerns and vary in length. We’ll prepare you with what
        to expect before your test.
    - question: What if I already have a diagnosis?
      answer: >-
        Mind Team tests can re-confirm or contest diagnosis for a variety of
        conditions. If you are confident in your diagnosis and simply need
        guidance and support, Mind Team treatment services are here to help.
    - question: What if you can’t diagnose me?
      answer: >-
        It’s completely possible (and normal) to be neurodivergent without
        meeting the full symptomatic requirements for an official condition
        diagnosis. 


        Ruling conditions out is still a vital step in the process and will help
        us get the information we need to successfully transition into the
        treatment phase.
    - question: What’s included?
      answer: >-
        Our top priority at Mind Team is to provide you with the most
        professional neurodivergent testing possible, which includes hours of
        behind-the scenes work from our multidisciplinary team.


        To ensure you get the most accurate, empowering and helpful support
        possible, your Mind Team testing investment includes:


        - Professional intake interview

        - Direct costs of testing materials and professional evaluators

        - Testing administration

        - Test scoring

        - Record, background and history review

        - Interpretation of test findings

        - Collaborative consultation among our multidisciplinary team

        - Professional review
treatment_faq_block:

  heading: Treatment FAQs
  questions:
    - question: Who will I be working with?
      answer: >-
        Your Mind Team clinician will be chosen specifically for your needs from
        our multidisciplinary team of interventionists, school psychologists and
        more.
    - question: How long does treatment take?
      answer: >-
        Treatment is a very different experience for every learner, and timing
        can vary. We’ll work with you to create a custom treatment timeline
        based on your needs.
    - question: Why does treatment pricing vary so much?
      answer: >-
        Your Mind Team clinician, as well as your unique treatment plan, is
        customized to your/your child’s specific mind and needs.
    - question: Do I need a referral to get treatment?
      answer: >-
        No. Because treatment services are paid out of pocket, we do not require
        referrals or official condition diagnoses to schedule Mind Team
        treatment services.
    - question: Do I need Mind Team testing before I get treatment?
      answer: >-
        Ideally, your journey with Mind Team will begin with one of our
        professional assessments to diagnose applicable conditions and identify
        other key information that will be extremely beneficial to the treatment
        process. 


        However, it is not a requirement to get a Mind Team test before starting
        treatment. Begin by filling out our short questionnaire and we’ll be in
        touch to find the best solution for your unique situation and needs.

  questions:
    - question: Can I pay with an HSA or FSA account?
      answer: >-
        Yes, Mind Team accepts electronic HSA/FSA payments via our online
        payment platform.
    - question: Do you accept insurance?
      answer: >-
        While we do not accept insurance of any kind, many insurance providers
        offer out-of-network reimbursement for professional testing and/or
        treatment services. 


        If you choose to pursue reimbursement, your Mind Team payment process
        will remain the same. Once you’ve made your electronic payment via our
        online portal, you can then file a claim with your insurance provider
        for full or partial reimbursement, depending on your coverage. 


        Or, you can utilize the assistance of <a href="https://reimbursify.com/"
        target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Reimbursify</a> and

        the reimbursement process less of a hassle.
    - question: How do I file a reimbursement claim?
      answer: >-
        Filing for reimbursement can be a difficult process, which is why we’ve
        partnered with <a href="https://reimbursify.com/" target="_blank"
        rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Reimbursify</a> and <a

        noreferrer">Zaya Health</a>. These companies help file your claim
        quickly and do the hard work for you.


        If you plan on filing a reimbursement claim, we highly recommend
        contacting your insurance provider prior to scheduling your Mind Team
        service. Some providers require <a

        authorization</a> to approve reimbursement coverage.
