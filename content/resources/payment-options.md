    Frequently asked <span class="underline underline--secondary">payment
    option</span> questions
  questions:
    - question: What’s included?
      answer: >-
        Our top priority at Mind Team is to provide you with the most
        professional neurodivergent testing possible, which includes hours of
        behind-the-scenes work from our multidisciplinary team.


        To ensure you get the most accurate, empowering and helpful support
        possible, your Mind Team testing investment includes:


        * Professional intake interview

        * Direct costs of testing materials and professional evaluators

        * Testing administration

        * Test scoring

        * Record, background and history review

        * Interpretation of test findings

        * Collaborative consultation among our multidisciplinary team

        * Report preparation

        * Professional review
    - question: Why does treatment pricing vary so much?
      answer: >-
        Your Mind Team clinician, as well as your unique treatment plan, is
        customized to your/your child’s specific mind and needs. 



        Some individuals work with interventionists, while others work with
        school psychologists or clinicians specializing in autism or ADHD
        treatment. Your hourly treatment rate will depend on the type of
        clinician that best suits your needs.
    - question: Do you accept insurance?
      answer: >-
        While we do not accept insurance of any kind, many insurance providers
        offer out-of-network reimbursement for professional testing and/or
        treatment services.


        If you choose to pursue reimbursement, your Mind Team payment process
        will remain the same. Once you’ve made your electronic payment via our
        online portal, you can then file a claim with your insurance provider
        for full or partial reimbursement, depending on your coverage.


        Or, you can utilize the assistance of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener
        noreferrer nofollower" href="https://reimbursify.com/">Reimbursify</a>
        and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollower"
        href="https://www.zaya.health/">Zaya Health</a>, who we’ve partnered
        with to make the reimbursement process less of a hassle.
    - question: How do I file a reimbursement claim?
      answer: >-
        Filing for reimbursement can be a difficult process, which is why we’ve
        partnered with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollower"
        href="https://reimbursify.com/">Reimbursify</a> and <a target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer nofollower"
        href="https://www.zaya.health/">Zaya Health</a>. These companies help
        file your claim quickly and do the hard work for you.


        If you plan on filing a reimbursement claim, we highly recommend
        contacting your insurance provider prior to scheduling your Mind Team
        service. Some providers require <a target="_blank" rel="noopener
        noreferrer nofollower"
        href="https://www.priorauthtraining.org/prior-authorization/">prior
        authorization</a> to approve reimbursement coverage.


        When contacting your provider, ask if any of the following <a
