Dr. Meggers-Wright, PhD, is a licensed clinical psychologist and one of the founders of Behavioral Health Clinic. She holds a PhD from the University of Missouri.

Dr. Meggers-Wright is dedicated to providing evidence-based treatments that are supported by science as being effective in producing measurable change. She takes a goal-focused approach that includes working together with her clients to define their goals, determine struggles getting in the way, and create achievable steps to meet those goals.

Dr. Meggers-Wright also specializes in providing high-quality care to busy professionals who have increased privacy concerns due to their occupation or community involvement. She offers online counseling using a HIPAA-secure video platform to maximize convenience and confidentiality if office visits create a barrier for treatment. Video-based counseling is covered by many insurers, and she accepts self-pay for those whose insurance coverage is behind the times.

Dr. Meggers-Wright can provide online counseling to residents of the states indicated in blue on this map.
