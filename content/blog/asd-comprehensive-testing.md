With the quick advancements of telehealth during the Covid19 pandemic, many services that traditionally were available in person&nbsp; moved online. While this has been a benefit to many, it also has some drawbacks. For example, it is difficult to determine the quality of services being provided in a virtual setting. While the online format does make it easier to access&nbsp; care, not all servicers provide high quality care. Autism diagnostic testing is one form of virtual care that has popped up across the internet. While this has made testing easier to access for many people , it has also led to many people receiving poorer care..&nbsp;

Autism is a diagnosis that is based on the presence of certain behaviors and because of this, diagnosis ultimately comes down to diagnostic criteria and clinical judgment (Kaufman, 2020). There are also well documented sex/gender differences in symptoms and lived experience of autism, specifically with females, which can contribute to being “missed” by standard assessment methods. This supports the need for comprehensive, multi-method assessments by trained experts (Zwaigenbaum, et al., 2020). It is also suggested that research supported assessments be used in conjunction with clinical judgment (Kaufman, 2020). Clinical judgment takes into account the expertise and knowledge of the clinician with the lived experiences of the Autistic individual.&nbsp;

Best practices currently suggest using a variety of methods to evaluate for Autism=. This includes direct observation and reviewing a comprehensive developmental history that provides information of behavior in multiple settings (Zwaigenbaum, et al., 2021), as well as using research based assessment tools. For diagnosis, a specific test is not required. Research suggests that the overall assessment be comprehensive and include cognitive ability/functioning (IQ), adaptive functioning, executive functioning, attention and processing speed, and personality assessment and documentation of behaviors in multiple environments, situations, and by multiple people familiar with the individual (Kaufman, 2020). Ng, Heinrich, and Hodges (2019) support comprehensive assessment as well and used measures of intellectual functioning, attention, social-cognitive and affective functioning, and measures of executive functioning in their assessment protocol for research in determining differences between Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and the presentation of both diagnoses. This approach includes parent and teacher observations as well and highlights the importance of behavioral observation in combination with the above mentioned testing. Many studies have emphasized the importance of clinical expertise to help understand the unique circumstances of each individual (Zwaigenbaum, et al., 2021 and Spain, et al., 2022). Spain, et al., (2022) also examined the feasibility and acceptability of assessments via telehealth and found that when conducted by an experienced clinician with training for online assessment and understanding of lifespan development, online assessments are effective and have good reliability. Other studies that reviewed virtual ASD assessments before and during the pandemic, found that they are feasible, effective, and reliable.&nbsp;

One of the other benefits to remote assessment is that it allows for the clinician to “see family dynamics” as well as “parent child interactions” and “favorite toys.” This allows for the clinician to see behaviors that otherwise would not be observed in a clinical setting (Spain, et al., 2022).&nbsp;

When autism is suspected, individuals deserve high quality, thoughtful, and scientifically-supported assessments (Kaufman, 2020). We at MindTeam are proudly committed to providing you with high quality, individualized care throughout the process.&nbsp;
