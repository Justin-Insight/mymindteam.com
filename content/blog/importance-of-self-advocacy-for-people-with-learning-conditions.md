Self-advocacy encourages you to speak up for your rights and remain confident in your school or workplace.

Self-advocacy involves the following aspects:

* Identifying your weaknesses
* Identifying your strengths
* Identifying strategies to overcome your weaknesses
* Communicating your needs

## Some Tips for Self-Advocacy:

* Know your rights and the accommodations available to you. There are specific laws such as [ADAA](https://ldaamerica.org/lda_today/section-504-the-tool-that-should-be-in-every-advocates-toolkit/) and [IDEA](https://ldaamerica.org/lda_today/section-504-the-tool-that-should-be-in-every-advocates-toolkit/) that can help you.
* Ask for support and help from others if needed. There is nothing to be ashamed of.
* You don't need to reveal your diagnosis to other people. This article by [Shelia Graham and Ronald English](https://www.ldonline.org/ld-topics/college-college-prep/requesting-academic-accommodations) has some practice scenarios to disclose learning conditions/challenges.

## Importance of Self-Advocacy:

Self-Advocacy can help you in finding and embracing your unique abilities. It can help people with ADHD, autism and other learning disorders or differences shine in their education system and workplaces.

## Self-Advocacy in School and College:

If you are in school and are experiencing certain difficulties (such as being easily distracted, experiencing anxiety, finding yourself being impulsive, have difficulty in managing the tasks or are unable to understand assignments), you may benefit from self-advocacy!

Speak to your instructors about your learning disorder and what help you may need from them.

## The Help of Teachers and Parents in Self-Advocating for Students:

Encourage your child to speak up and reach out to your childâ€™s teachers to begin problem solving.

If you are a teacher, you could add some learning material (such as [LD Online blog](https://www.ldonline.org/ld-topics/adhd), assessments from the [Headstrong Notion site](http://headstrongnation.org/parents/learn-the-facts), etc) in the classroom to educate your students about the importance of self-advocacy.

## Self-Advocacy in Workplaces:

If you need any accommodations in the workplace, remain confident about it and create a strong ground to ask for them.

Develop yourself as a sufficient part of the workplace. Help other people, identify your strengths and take full advantage of them. These strengths will help you in growing your career.

When you remember that your neuropsychological disorders don't weaken you but make you a unique individual, you can self-advocate for yourself in every part of life.
