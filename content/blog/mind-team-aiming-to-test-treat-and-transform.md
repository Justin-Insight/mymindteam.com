Mind Team’s mission is to improve people’s lives by inspiring personal growth. Mind Team offers person-centered virtually-based services, including assessment services and interventions for individuals with learning or social-emotional differences. Licensed Clinical and School Psychologists provide essential behavioral health and psychoeducational services across the country in inclusive and confidential protocols while using best practices in our field.&nbsp;

Mind Team is your solution for developmental, learning, and executive functioning problems. Clinical psychologists, school psychologists, testing, and learning specialists bring our collaborative expertise on neuropsychological and psychological conditions that affect school, home, work, and social functioning to the table to provide targeted guidance on how to improve your life. Mind Team cuts through red tape to give you on-demand testing and immediate access to important interventions exactly when and where you need them.

We formulate a fully integrated understanding of your learner’s needs with a fully integrated plan of support. To that end we maintain a highly qualified staff of clinicians and a cooperative relationship with the surrounding educational community.

We provide highly specialized evaluations and uniquely structured support for students with atypical learning profiles and their families. Our work is research-based and academically sound.&nbsp;

**For those just starting out**, we’ll help you understand which evaluation, if any, is most appropriate. Our diagnosticians are also practitioners, which allow us to both offer AND implement a uniquely individualized treatment plan. We guide families through the process, and we suggest work that you can do at home to supplement the educational support we provide. Our approaches are research-based and refined by our years of experience working with clients across the spectrum of learning abilities.

**For those with prior evaluations**, or who have already engaged with learning therapies, we’ll review past results and consult on the best next step. We’re happy to take that next step with you if desired. When you need help coordinating with schools and other institutions, we’re there for you. As educators ourselves, we communicate directly with other professionals. In all of these interactions, we act as collaborative advocates. We keep your learner’s needs at the center of the conversation.

All of our evaluations result in a personalized report with specific actionable recommendations for remediation. We get to the core of the difficulty and our recommendations can result in significant changes.

*FOR KIDS UNDER 12*

It has been said that kindergarten through third grade is learning to read and after that is reading to learn. Research findings unilaterally point to the importance of early instruction in later learning. To that end, it’s critical to identify inefficiencies through early intervention and develop strategies to more explicitly and directly build these skills in an individualized way.

*FOR 12 TO 18 YEARS*

When language and learning disabilities have gone undetected, secondary struggles can manifest in terms of social struggles, organizational difficulties, motivational challenges, and mood disorders. Our evaluations can help disentangle the relative contribution of these and other factors. Our coaching and educational therapy services can help turn educational mountains into molehills.

*OLDER THAN 18*

A considerable proportion of our clients are adults, and the eagerness with which they approach professional and educational difficulties can be as impressive as it is inspiring. When adversity hits, many can finally push through the shame that has prevented them from seeking help. When young adults are off the beaten path of college in four years (which is increasingly the case), our diagnostic and coaching services can play instrumental roles in identifying and overcoming learning and production struggles.

*Psychoeducational evaluations*

A comprehensive psychoeducational evaluation documents a child’s, adolescent’s, or adult’s information processing strengths and weaknesses as they impact educational and social functioning. A complete evaluation includes detailed information about cognitive aptitude, thinking skills, memory, executive functioning, visual perceptual skills, phonological processing, receptive and expressive oral language, and academic functioning in reading, written language, and mathematics.

The measures used in psychoeducational evaluations are nationally normed and standardized, and because they are individually administered (instead of group-administered tests at school), qualitative approaches to individual items are integrated. These evaluations can be used to guide school services in areas where an individual is struggling, such as an IEP or 504 Plan. In other instances, the evaluations can be used for placement into giftedness programming.

*Neuropsychological evaluations*

Neuropsychological evaluations broadly assess psychological functioning across attentional, social-emotional, cognitive, and academic domains. They can help rule in or rule out the presence of ADHD, anxiety, depression, spectrum disorders, learning disabilities, dementia, and other conditions. Our evaluations go well beyond labeling; subtle interplay between neurocognitive strengths and weaknesses can help drive and fine tune recommendations for services provided either at school or privately. Personalized recommendations found at the end of the evaluations provide a very specific and personalized guide for the individual to address the issue of concern.&nbsp;

*Post-evaluation Consultations*

Results of educational or neuropsychological evaluations can be complex. We do our best to make our reports understandable and the recommendations reasonable and attainable. We will work with parents, students, and school staff to implement the assessment recommendations. We can help parents advocate for their children and we can assist schools in finding the most appropriate intervention strategies.

*Educational Therapy*

Educational therapy helps individuals who are experiencing academic struggles progress and fulfill their learning potential. Educational therapy is personalized instruction for individuals experiencing learning differences and disabilities, including Dyslexia, ADHD, Executive Functioning Deficits, Language Disorders, or auditory and visual processing deficits. The following are areas where skills can be enhanced: Academic skills (increases in reading, written language, or math scores), learning behaviors (organization, problem solving, task -initiation, motivation) and social/ emotional skills.
