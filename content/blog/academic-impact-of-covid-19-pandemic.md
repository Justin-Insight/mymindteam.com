  meta_description: >-
    With the pandemic came many changes and disruptions to our children’s
    education regardless of their age. Emerging research is suggesting that our
    infants and toddlers are experiencing speech and language delays, social
    emotional developmental delays, and that for school age children and teens,
    we are seeing the significant impact these disruptions have had on academic
    performance.

With the pandemic came many changes and disruptions to our children’s education regardless of their age. Emerging research is suggesting that our infants and toddlers are experiencing speech and language delays, social emotional developmental delays, and that for school age children and teens, we are seeing the significant impact these disruptions have had on academic performance. Students went weeks without school which was followed by online learning and then time back in the classroom but with distance protocols and masking in place. Now is a perfect time to help your child begin to “catch up” on the skills that didn’t develop at the expected pace.&nbsp;

Unicef reports that, globally, children have lost basic skills due to missing out on academic learning they would have acquired in the classroom. In low and middle income countries, learning losses have left up to 70% of 10-year-olds unable to read at age level which is up from 53% prior to the pandemic. In the United States in particular, Unicef reports studies indicate that learning losses have been observed in many states. In Texas, as an example, two-thirds of children in the 3rd grade tested below grade level in math in 2021 compared to only half being behind in these skills in 2019. Research is indicating that, globally, our students are approximately 8-months-behind where they would have been without the pandemic and in the United States we are seeing a 2-4 month delay (McKinsey). The Brookings Institution also found significant decreases in academic performance in their studies. However, they highlight a positive in that these drops in test scores don’t suggest that our children are a “lost generation” or that we should give up hope. There is a likelihood of recovery.&nbsp;

At MindTeam, we are proud to help support you and your learner(s). We welcome opportunities to discuss our intervention support- interventions that have been scientifically proven to assist your child’s development in math, reading, and executive functioning skills. These interventions can be done from the privacy of your own home and are supported by a school psychologist who will provide you and your child’s school with progress updates.
