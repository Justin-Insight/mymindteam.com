#### Is Covid Behind My Child's Academic Struggles?

While Covid may not be the direct cause of your child's academic struggles, the pandemic has no doubt had both direct and indirect impacts on most children.&nbsp;

The widespread closures of schools and daycares have resulted in many children having to learn at home, often without the help of a parent or guardian. This has been and still is extremely difficult, especially for younger children still adjusting to a traditional school setting.&nbsp;

In addition, the increased stress and anxiety that has come with living in a pandemic has taken its toll on children's academic performance. Many kids are worried about getting sick, or about their loved ones getting sick. Some may be dealing with trauma from witnessing the effects of the virus firsthand.&nbsp;

All of this has made it difficult for children to focus on their schoolwork. As a result, some have fallen behind.&nbsp;

New research from the National Center of Education Statistics has reported the first significant drop in math scores since the 1970s and the first significant drop in reading scores in more than 30 years for our nation’s 9-year-olds. Even when accounting for specific subgroups of children, no subgroup showed growth in any subject area – they all either remained approximately the same or decreased.&nbsp;

#### What Can I Do to Help My Child?

As parents of school age children, this new research is concerning. You are often left wondering, “What can I do to increase my child’s learning?” If you're concerned that your child is struggling academically due to Covid-related disruptions, there are some things you can do to help.&nbsp;

##### Talk To Your Child's Teacher

If you're worried about your child's academic progress, the first step is to talk to their teacher. They can let you know how your child is doing in comparison to their classmates, and they may have some suggestions for ways you can help at home.&nbsp;

Children spend more time with their teachers than anyone else during the school day, so they are in a good position to give you insights into your child's strengths and weaknesses.&nbsp;

##### Create a Schedule

One of the best ways to help your child stay on track with their schoolwork is to create a daily schedule. This will give them a sense of structure and routine, which can be helpful in times of uncertainty.&nbsp;

Be sure to include time for schoolwork, but also allow for some flexibility in case your child needs a break. It's important to find a balance that works for your family.&nbsp;

##### Get Outside

Try to encourage outdoor activity even in the colder months! Fresh air and exercise can do wonders for your child's focus and concentration.&nbsp;

Remember, your child is still a kid, and they need time to play and just be kids. Too much pressure to perform academically can lead to a variety other issues.&nbsp;

##### Seek Professional Help

If you're really concerned about your child's academic struggles, it may be time to seek professional help. A therapist or counselor can help your child manage their anxiety and stress, which may in turn help them focus better in school.&nbsp;
