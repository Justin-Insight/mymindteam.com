ADHD has been a “buzzword” recently given the increase in people sharing their lived experiences on social media apps such as TikTok and Instagram. Many adults, teens, and children are adjusting to a post-pandemic transition back to work and school following months of increased flexibility, allowing for more behaviors like procrastination. ADHD can be diagnosed at any age, but this diagnosis is neurodevelopmental– which means it is a result of differences in brain structure and functioning that have been present since early childhood. There can also be instances of medically induced ADHD in which certain medical conditions can contribute to an onset of or exacerbation of symptoms. ADHD symptoms, such as inattention and impulsivity, can also be related to other mental health diagnoses as well. These include things like anxiety, depression, and trauma. A comprehensive testing session is the recommended way to differentiate between diagnoses to get accurate information for a medical diagnosis and to assist with treatment planning. Treatment for ADHD varies, but generally speaking, includes behavioral therapy and intervention for learning in addition to or in lieu of medication.&nbsp;

Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) can be diagnosed in children, teens, and adults. However, current diagnostic criteria requires that several symptoms must have been present before the age of 12 to make a diagnosis (Gascon, et al., 2022). According to Gascon, et al., (2022), studies suggest that the current common ADHD assessment instruments appear to be somewhat ineffective at discriminating genuine symptoms of the disorder and simulated symptoms. In studies that compare “genuine ADHD” to “simulated ADHD,” it was very difficult to differentiate the two, with a false positive rate of over 64% for children and over 38% for adults. Gascon, et al., (2022) show that these high false-positive rates are evidence of the need for adding other methods of assessment, such as semi-structured interviews, to make the testing process more comprehensive. Many symptoms of ADHD overlap with other conditions (such as depression and anxiety) and further highlight the importance of comprehensive testing.&nbsp;

Overall, the research suggests that a behavioral-only assessment (such as a symptom checklist) will not provide the comprehensive data that is needed for accurate diagnosis (Gascon, et al., 2022). Lefler, et al., (2021) highlight the importance of collateral or other person-report besides the client of current ADHD symptoms given that current research suggests that other person-report of current symptoms might be more accurate than self-report and retrospective parent-report has been shown to be more accurate than retrospective self-report (Lefler, et al., 2021). Research suggests that the use of historical records, ruling out alternative explanations (anxiety, depression, and others), and a review of achievement and general cognitive ability can be helpful for differentiation. Linck, et al., (2017) suggest that comprehensive assessment for ADHD include history, assessment of cognitive skills, review of academic history, review of attention and concentration in addition to processing speed, personality, and executive functioning be included.&nbsp;
