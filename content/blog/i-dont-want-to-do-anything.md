I don’t want to do anything” If this sentence defines what you’re feeling then the question you need to ask yourself is “why do I feel like this?” Is it because something happened in your day to make you feel like this or because is it something you have been feeling for a long time? It could also be a symptom of an underlying mental health disorder.

What if watching your favorite TV show, reading your favorite book, or hanging out with your friends doesn’t bring you happiness anymore? What if doing something you love doesn’t make you happy?

There could be a reason for this, though. On some days, this feeling of doing nothing can be temporary and brought on by stress. But if you’re feeling like doing nothing anymore for longer than a few weeks then this feeling can be apathy or if you’re not enjoying doing things you once loved doing then this feeling can be anhedonia.

Feeling unmotivated can happen anytime to any one of us. However, if you’re losing interest in things and feeling unmotivated all the time, then it could be a symptom of a major depressive disorder.

If you hear yourself saying, “I don’t want to do anything anymore in my life” then you must also be familiar with this saying; “I’m feeling okay then why don’t I feel motivated?”

On some days, this feeling of not wanting to do anything can be a sign of laziness but there is a difference here. You see, if you’re being lazy then you are choosing not to do anything but what if it’s not your choice? Many people who are depressed lose energy and interest in doing simple stuff like getting up in the mornings.

If your feelings resonate with what I have said yet, then you may need some professional help from a counselor or a therapist because more often than not this feeling of not wanting to do anything anymore is an underlying symptom of depression.

**Here are some things you can do if you’re feeling not wanting to do anything:**

## What To Do If You Don’t Want To Do Anything?

### 1. Do Nothing

Sometimes when you feel not wanting to do something – do nothing. You must be wondering what kind of advice is this, right? But believe me, not doing anything is also doing something. This feeling is your mind’s way of asking to take a break. It needs to rest and recharge and sometimes doing nothing is what you need.

Snuggle with your pet, curl up in your blanket, and sip a hot cup of tea – do nothing but shut your mind off and relax.

### 2. Walk, Jog, Run

When I’m not in the mood to do anything, I find myself walking around in my garden. Even for 10 minutes, the walk helps me reset my mind and mood. If you want to go for a walk in nature, jog around the block, or go for a run in the park? Do!

Sometimes, sitting on my terrace, doing nothing but watching the sunset or sunrise helps me calm and relax. If you want, you can also take a small trip to your favorite coffee shop. Changing your environment for a while can help you feel better.

### 3. Talk To Your Emotions

When this feeling of nothingness comes up, take a note of your emotions. Talk to them and identify why you don’t want to do anything. What is it that you’re feeling (or lack thereof)? Are you:

- Anxious
- Worried
- Stressed
- Sad, or
- Lonely

Once you’re able to understand the cause of your feelings, you’ll be able to make sense of what’s happening. Figure out what exactly led up to this point? Was it something that happened in the day? At work? Or at home? Is what you’re feeling new? Or were you feeling like this weeks ago?

### 4. Meditate

Okay, so I know, technically meditation is doing something but what if you don’t look at it as an activity? Meditation can be done in various ways:

- Music meditation
- Pet mediation
- Metta meditation

Take your pick! All you have to do is: close your eyes and let yourself accept your emotions without letting them taking control of your mind and heart.

### 5. Phone A Friend

Talking to a friend is not a chore, is it? So, phone a friend and talk to them about nothing and everything. The key here is finding the right friend to help you. Here, a friend can suggest to you some activities you can participate in or they can be an ear when you want to vent out your frustrations.

Friends are people who know us better than we know ourselves, so asking them to lend a helping hand can be helpful in such situations.

### 6. Listen To Music

When you’re listening to music you’re not alone, are you? Music fills the silence in our heads with beautiful lyrics and rhythm. Even if you don’t want to get out of bed, you can just pug in your headphones and listen to your favorite music to help you. Listening to my favorite music energizes me, gives me the kind of push I need, and puts a smile on my face. Did you know that music works as therapy? It boosts our mood and reduces the pain and symptoms of depression.

So the next time you don’t want to do anything, plug in your headphones and listen to your favorite song!

Bonus: My favorite song is ‘Walking On Sunshine’ by Katrina & The Waves. What’s yours? Comment below!

### 7. Run Some Errands

While this is technically doing something, running some errands can help you clear your mind and set it back on track. Make a list of the things that need to be done and tackle them now. Why wait?

I know that going out and running errands might be the last thing on your mind but doing something (even taking a trip to the grocery store) can help your mind take a break from the feeling of not wanting to do anything to doing something that needs to be done.

### 8. Check-In With Yourself

Self-care is very important! Check-in with yourself and look at what your body or mind needs at this moment. Not taking care of yourself can also lead you to feel lazy and apathetic. What do you need? Do you need sleep? Do you need some “me time”? Do you need to eat?

Asking yourself these questions can help you figure out what is it that you’re missing from your care. Do not forget to take care of yourself!

### 9. Stick To A Routine

Make a plan or a routine and stick to it. When we are in this phase of not wanting to do anything, we often forget the simple things that help keep our spirits up. Stick to a routine:

- Get up early
- Do your daily tasks
- Keep yourself busy
- See your family or friends
- Go to bed on time

Remember to not be hard on yourself if you’re not able to stick to your schedule. Take all the time you need to care for yourself.

### 10. Read Or Listen To An Audiobook

When I don’t want to do anything I take out my favorite book and read. It’s okay if you don’t want to do anything. Reading a book is a low-key way of feeling productive. If you’re not in the mood to read, you can always listen to an audiobook or a podcast.

Sit in a comfortable and quiet place, curl up in your favorite chair with your book and do nothing. Let the words heal you.

**My Thoughts…**

Sometimes not wanting to do anything can be a sign of fatigue and tiredness but if this feeling persists for longer than a few weeks or months then it can be a sign or symptom of depression. If you’re constantly feeling:

- Low energy
- Loss of interest in things you love
- Disinterest in almost everything
- Thoughts of self-harm or suicide
- Changes in mood
- Hopeless or emptiness

Then it is recommended that you speak to a professional mental healthcare provider, immediately. You can also write to us at info@calmsage.com or connect with our licensed counselors by visiting our services page.
