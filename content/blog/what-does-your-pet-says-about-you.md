What Does Your Pet Say About You

1. Dog Person

A dog person tends to be more energetic and outgoing. The number of dog owners is greater than other pet owners. Dog persons are more likely to be a stickler of rules and are associated with self-confidence and assertiveness.

Dog owners are often found living with a spouse, a partner, or other family members, preferring to share their space with others than living alone.

2. Cat Person

4. Reptile Person
   People with reptiles as pets are considered very unique and independent in nature. They like their space as much as their pet likes theirs. Reptile owners don’t tend to be the centre of attention and are more analytical.

Reptile owners can be described as unpredictable, unconventional, hard-working, goal-oriented but reliable too.

5. Fish Person
   A fish owner finds humor in situations and tends to lead a happy and satisfying life. Fish owners are very optimistic and content in nature. Fish owners can be described as more emotionally strong and calm than others.

If you own more than one – or a different kind – of pet, then you are content with having different personalities and each is more appealing than the other. It doesn’t really matter what kind of pet or how many pets you own. What it all comes down to is how you treat your pet and others – humans and animals alike.

Having a furry friend is no different from having a human one. Cuddling up with your furry companion, playing games with them, and marveling in their playful innocence is the best therapy you can need in the time of a global pandemic.

Look at the world from their eyes and let go of your worries.

The easiest way to enjoy life is to find happiness in the little things around you. What better way to do that with your pet.
