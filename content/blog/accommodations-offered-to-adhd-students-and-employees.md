Children and adults with unique behavior such as social anxiety, inability to pay attention and difficulty controlling impulses can face issues in their schools and workplaces. It may indicate that they are being affected by ADHD or other learning disorders or differences.

If you or your child is facing such issues, don't worry. We can help you in diagnosing your neural differences and can help you in providing the accommodations you need.

In compliance with the [Americans with Disability Act](https://adata.org/factsheet/ADA-overview), Mind Team provides academic and cognitive achievement testing for possible ADHD, learning disabilities, learning differences and other neuropsychological deficits.

We use only nationally-recognized, well-validated testing methods to ensure our evaluations are objective and accurate. Our evaluations may indicate the need for testing accommodations in the classroom, workplace, or in standardized testing (such as SAT, MCAT, LSAT, EPPP and Bar Exams).

After being properly diagnosed, the next step you have to take is to work with a practitioner and workplace or school setting to decide on proper accommodations that match your diagnosis.

Let's see what accommodations you or your child can gain in school or at workplaces.

The Federal Government passed the Americans with Disability Act (ADA) of 1990 to create accommodations for people with different neuropsychological disorders.

Workers can ask for special accommodation in the workplace.

* No qualified person should be excluded from any service, activity, or benefits of a service
* If the person's education and skills are suitable for the job, no one can reject them because of their disability
* If possible, create some changes in the workplace for the relief of workers with ADHD symptoms. It can involve giving them preferential seating to decrease distractions
* Workers with symptoms can discuss their issues with their HR department and can come up with realistic solutions

Our multidisciplinary team can help you in identifying what type of accommodation you need and can set them up for you to let you flourish and tackle the challenges you face.
