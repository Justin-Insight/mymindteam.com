Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) has become a trending topic in recent months thanks to information being widely available via social media. Struggling with attention, however, does not necessarily mean a person meets the diagnostic criteria for ADHD. Differences in attention and focus as well as impulsivity and hyperactivity can be attributed to many things- this is why comprehensive testing is so important for accurate diagnosis. Difficulties with attention and focus are common symptoms of depression, anxiety, trauma, and medical conditions. Difficulties related to impulsivity and hyperactivity are common symptoms of mood disorders, personality disorders, substance use, and medical conditions. A qualified professional is the only person a true ADHD diagnosis can come from - a medical doctor, a psychiatrist, or a psychologist. These professionals have undergone specific training on understanding testing, results, and presentation of symptoms and have had training on how to read and interpret the results of the assessments. Because symptoms related to ADHD can be complicated to differentiate from other disorders, testing is often required before a primary care provider will prescribe a psychostimulant for ADHD. This is to help ensure a person is getting the best intervention to treat the source of their inattention and/or impulsivity. Much like you wouldn’t take a pain reliever to manage diabetes, you don’t want to take medication that is not for the source of your difficulties.&nbsp;

The first line treatment for ADHD is a psychostimulant. These are considered to be controlled substances in the United States because they can be, and are, widely abused. There is potential for addiction when not taken as prescribed. In fact, stimulants are not habit-forming in the doses used to treat ADHD for children and teens. However, those with other health conditions can experience dangerous side effects and people at risk for addiction need their usage monitored carefully. There is a risk of addiction in stimulant use for all adults.&nbsp; In high doses, stimulants can lead to a high body temperature, irregular heartbeat, heart failure, and seizures. This is why stimulants are regulated and why proper diagnosis is necessary. Additionally, there are common side effects that everyone needs to be aware of and it’s important to weigh out whether the benefits outweigh the risks. Psychostimulants may also be used to treat other disorders, such as narcolepsy, and several medications for depression include norepinephrine.&nbsp;

&nbsp;Stimulants increase activity of the brain chemicals dopamine and norepinephrine. Dopamine is a chemical in your brain that makes you feel good and norepinephrine is released by the brain when a threat is perceived. This affects your blood vessels and blood pressure and heart rate. ADHD brains have low norepinephrine and norepinephrine works with dopamine. An ADHD brain has impaired activity in specific areas: the frontal cortex, limbic system, basal ganglia, and reticular activating system. These areas of the brain regulate attention, emotion, executive functions, and impulsivity/hyperactivity. Neuropsychological testing helps your provider gather information on how these areas of your brain react to specific stimuli and prompts. As such, just answering a few questions about your behavior doesn’t help differentiate if brain differences are impacting your attention and focus or if the difficulties with attention, focus and/or impulsivity or hyperactivity are caused by ADHD or a different diagnosis. This is where comprehensive testing becomes important- for what is called differential diagnosis. This is where a clinician gathers a thorough background of your symptoms, behaviors, and also uses scientifically backed tools to gain information about patterns and collect relevant information related to your brain and behavioral styles and then compare it to diagnostic criteria. Diagnostic criteria for mental health is established in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - 5th Edition, Text Revision (DSM-5-TR). This text is used in the medical field to identify and label mental health conditions based on specific symptoms and behaviors for specific periods of time. For a diagnosis, there needs to be a specific number of symptoms, for a specific period of time, that meets specific criteria. For this reason, it can be difficult at times to label someone’s symptoms because everything exists on a spectrum - meaning symptoms can be mild, moderate, or severe at different times throughout one's life. Your provider has an ethical obligation to ensure that you are provided with an accurate diagnosis based on your symptoms. This diagnosis may not be what you had in mind, but can help you and your medical provider plan the best course of action for treating your symptoms.&nbsp;
