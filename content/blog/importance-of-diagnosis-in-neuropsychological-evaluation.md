Diagnosis is the first and critical part of neuropsychological evaluation. It can be a daunting time when seeking out testing and being diagnosed with any learning disabilities, but there is no need to get anxious. Believe us, it is beneficial for you!

We have seen that people before being diagnosed with neuropsychological conditions feel depressed, frustrated, and alone. After diagnosis, they feel well-informed, secure, and comfortable. They now know more about themselves and can adjust their lives according to what theyâ€™ve learned. 

Don't think of diagnosis as a label, but a path that can lead you toward a secure and bright future.

Let's see the idea behind this whole diagnosis purpose: 

* Any atypical or unique pattern of behavior is occurring in an individual.

* This pattern has been observed in [a lot of other humans](https://www.adhdawarenessmonth.org/children-do-not-grow-out-of-adhd/) too.

* Over time, scientists became alert and based on their observations, they gave a name and solution to this behavior.

We can help you in understanding your behavioral patterns and can guide you on how to deal with them. See, it was simple and helpful! If you are afraid that people will think negatively of you, do know that there are a lot of people in society who have been diagnosed with different neuropsychological conditions.

Let us tell you some statistics.

According to a comprehensive study, ADHD is one of the most common learning disorders diagnosed in children. Another [study](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/04/1-in-68-children-now-has-a-diagnosis-of-autism-spectrum-disorder-why/360482/) shows that 1 in 68 children in the UK has been affected by autism.

It is not only present in children; adults can also have this condition. It has been [observed](https://chadd.org/adhd-weekly/grow-out-of-adhd-not-likely/) that 50 to 86% of adults have the symptoms of ADHD if they have this condition in their childhood.

Diagnosis can help you in a lot of ways:

1. It will help you to identify more about yourself and your path.

2. It will allow you to learn about the journey of other people and how you can cope with this pattern.

3. It will give you an idea about the changes that can occur in your routine.

4. It will help you identify how to best work with your primary care provider to achieve living your very best life!

Testing will help you in dealing with low mood, anxiety, and stress. It will allow you to see the life around you through a fresh perspective and live your life with confidence.

Do know that your path will be different from others? You don't need to notice or undergo the same things as other people have. You will have your own path, and diagnosis will give you a clear idea of your path.

So, let us help you in identifying your unique self and guiding you toward your unique path.
