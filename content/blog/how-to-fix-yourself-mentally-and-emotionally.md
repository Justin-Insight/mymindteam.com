> “Mental health…is not a destination, but a process. It’s about how you drive, not where you’re going.” — Noam Shpancer

Let’s talk. For many of us, life in the last few years has been a never-ending rollercoaster full of ups and downs – you know, the work, social life, relationships, and whatnot? On top of that, there’s the social pressure we face that can take a heavy toll on our mental and emotional health, leaving us scrambling for some semblance of stability.

We are living in uncertain times and in these unknown times, we are even more stressed than ever. Amid all this, we are struggling to keep a check on our emotional and mental wellness – an aspect of our life that is as important as physical and social wellness.

Unsurprisingly, many of us are asking ourselves, “How do I fix this? How do I fix myself mentally and emotionally?” Keeping in check our anger, confusion, loneliness, sadness, and worry, let’s take a look at how you can keep your mental and emotional self in check and keep it steady, even in these unprecedented times.

## “How Do I Fix Myself; Mentally And Emotionally?”

Emotional and mental health is one of the most important aspects of our lives because let’s be real; how can you move ahead in life if your mind and emotions are in a disarray? Repairing your mental health and maintaining your mental strength can help improve confidence and allow you to face the challenges in your life without backing out.

When you fix your mental and emotional health, you become stronger and fearless in the face of challenges and problems. Keeping your emotional and mental health in check also prevents all kinds of negative thoughts, self-doubt, and wallowing in self-pity.

Here are some tips you can follow!

## 1. Normalize Feeling All Emotions

If you’re wondering, “How do I fix myself?” then look within! The fixing begins with acceptance. Not all emotions are good and I understand that but that does not make those emotions, unacceptable.

Bottling up emotions can only work to decline and reduce your mental strength, so keep your chin up and accept your emotions as they are, even if they are sadness, anger, scared, or nervousness. Normalize feeling all emotions because, at the end of the day, it’s your emotions that help you feel and take charge of your situation.

## 2. Take A Break And Focus On SELF

Between work, social life, and other commitments, we’ve forgotten to care for our overall wellness. It’s time to take charge, starting with taking a break. Learn to prioritize yourself and put your mental and emotional needs before everything else.

No matter what you do, if you can’t care for yourself, you won’t be able to care for your loved one. So take a break and try to focus on yourself for once! Do things you enjoy without feeling guilty.

## 3. Adopt Healthy Coping Habits

Learning how to cope with your emotions can also help answer the question, “How do I fix myself- mentally and emotionally?” All you need to do is understand that the little habits you engage in when you’re stressed or overwhelmed can also affect your mental and emotional wellness.

Make sure you adopt healthier coping habits, for example, instead of wallowing in self-pity, try to practice meditation or journaling. Find something that you feel helps you.

## 4. Check In With Your Companions

The people you hang around with can also leave an impression on your mental and emotional Self. Positive people can replenish your mental strength whereas negative people can take the strength you’ve left away and leave you feeling empty.

So if you’re looking for ways to fix your mental and emotional self, try to spend time with positive people, who always support you. You can also try to join a support group or a club to reconnect with others.

## 5. Help Others To Help Yourself

Did you know that helping others can help us!? Well, volunteering in a homeless shelter or spending your time in other community services can help you seek the answer you’re looking for.

Helping others can make you feel like you’ve made a difference and feel good about yourself. It’s also a good way to make new friends and meet new and diverse people. Remember, helping others can help you!

## 6. Work On Your Mental Health Goals

Working or re-working on your mental health goals can also answer the question, “How do I fix myself mentally and emotionally?” Make a list of what you want to achieve for your mental wellness.

Write down the steps you need to take to reach those goals. Aim for realistic goals, and keep yourself grounded in reality. Working on these goals will help you reinstate what you need and where you want to be.

## 7. Shake Up Your Routine

Not everyone likes changing their routine and it’s understandable. Routine gives us a sense of normalcy (especially during these tumultuous times) and even a sense of stability but sometimes, a change in routine can do wonders for your mental and emotional wellness.

If you go for an evening walk in the park near you, then maybe try jogging in a different park today. Or maybe try a new cuisine tonight. Not all changes have to be big!

## 8. Learn To Be Self-Compassionate

One of the best ways to “fix yourself mentally and emotionally” is to be kind and compassionate towards yourself. Instead of letting your mental weakness hold you back, take a step back, and look at the scene (in this case, yourself) with a new lens.

Learn to be kind and patient with yourself as you would with a loved one. When you become less judgmental towards yourself, you learn to slowly but gradually repair your mental and emotional self.

## 9. Accept The Change

When you’re looking for the answer to “How can I mentally fix myself?”, it’s not far. All you need to do is embrace your past but not let it affect your present too much. It’s all about accepting the change you go through.

Not all changes are bad and while some changes might leave a scar behind, you can look past that and see the big picture. Accept that change is happening and maybe it’s not all bad.

## 10. Seek Professional Help, If Needed

When nothing seems to work and all you experience is a mental drain and emotional depletion, then seek professional support. Seeking help isn’t a weakness but one of the ways you can repair your mental strength and gain an understanding of your emotions.

With a professional’s help, you can learn where your emotions come from and how to effectively cope with them without losing yourself more in the process.

Accepting yourself means accepting the flaws and all – even the emotions you don’t like. Everything teaches us something and it’s only right to accept the lessons we learn. One way to repair yourself mentally and emotionally is to understand why they arise and what can be done to cope with them, healthily.
