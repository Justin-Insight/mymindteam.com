      neurodivergent testing?
    body: >-
      Children of any age can benefit from identifying their unique neural
      abilities and differences, whether or not they are currently struggling. 

      Getting a test scheduled is especially important if your child is
      experiencing any of the following:  

      - Under-developed writing, reading or math skills. 

      - Anxiety, fear or frustration centered around school and learning. 

      - Poor academic performance that doesn’t reflect their efforts or
      abilities. 

      - Discomfort, frustration and difficulty completing homework assignments. 

      - Difficulty sitting still and/or remaining focused. 

      - Difficulty relating to and/or interacting with their peers.
