      Signs of <span class="underline underline--accent">autism</span> in
      children.
    body: >-
      Your child may be struggling with autism and could benefit from a
      diagnosis if they:


      * Tend to get very upset by tastes, smells, sounds and textures they don’t
      like.

      * Struggle to relate to and interact with other children their age.

      * Avoid making/keeping eye contact.

      * Frequently repeat motions like hand flapping and rocking back and forth.

      * Break down, lash out and/or have trouble controlling their actions when
      upset.
