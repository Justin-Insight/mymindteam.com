  questions:

      answer: |-
        Your child will be matched with the licensed school psychologist who best fits their unique needs, based on your intake interview.

        Mind Team remote targeted subject tests are tailored to your child’s unique history, background and concerns and vary in length. We’ll prepare you with what to expect before their test.
    - question: Does my child need a referral for a targeted subject test?
      answer: >-
        No. Because Mind Team tests are paid out of pocket, you won’t need to obtain or wait for a referral to schedule your child’s test.
    - question: What if you can’t diagnose my child with dyslexia, dysgraphia or dyscalculia?
      answer: |-
        It’s completely possible (and normal) for children to struggle with a specific subject without meeting the full symptomatic requirements for an official condition diagnosis. 


        Ruling out dyslexia, dysgraphia and/or dyscalculia is still a vital step in the process to get the answers and support you and your child need to work <em>with</em> their unique mind. Mind Team treatment services can help, regardless of if your child receives an official condition diagnosis or not.
