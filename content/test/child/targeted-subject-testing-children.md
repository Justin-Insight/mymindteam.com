    Frequently asked <span class="underline underline--secondary">child targeted
    subject test</span> questions
  questions:
    - question: Who will conduct my child’s targeted subject test?
      answer: >-
        Your child will be matched with the licensed school psychologist who
        best fits their unique needs, based on your intake interview.
    - question: How long will my child’s targeted subject test take?
      answer: >-
        It depends. Mind Team remote targeted subject tests are tailored to your
        child’s unique history, background and concerns and vary in length.
        We’ll prepare you with what to expect before their test.
    - question: Does my child need a referral for a targeted subject test?
      answer: >-
        No. Because Mind Team tests are paid out of pocket, you won’t need to
        obtain or wait for a referral to schedule your child’s test.
    - question: >-
        What if you can’t diagnose my child with dyslexia, dysgraphia or
        dyscalculia?
      answer: >-
        It’s completely possible (and normal) for children to struggle with a
        specific subject without meeting the full symptomatic requirements for
        an official condition diagnosis. 



        Ruling out dyslexia, dysgraphia and/or dyscalculia is still a vital step
        in the process to get the answers and support you and your child need to
        work <em>with</em> their unique mind. Mind Team treatment services can
        help, regardless of if your child receives an official condition
        diagnosis or not.
