    Frequently asked <span class="underline
    underline--secondary">questions</span>
  questions:
    - question: Who will I be working with?
      answer: >-
        With our diverse, multidisciplinary team, you will be matched with the
        licensed clinician best suited to address your unique needs and
        concerns.
    - question: How long does testing take?
      answer: >-
        Mind Team assessments are tailored to your unique history, background
        and concerns, and vary in length. We’ll prepare you with what to expect
        before your test.
    - question: Do I need a referral?
      answer: >-
        No. Because Mind Team tests are paid out of pocket, you won’t need to
        obtain or wait for a referral, typically required by insurance
        providers.
    - question: What if I already have a diagnosis?
      answer: >-
        Mind Team tests can re-confirm or contest diagnosis for a variety of
        conditions. If you are confident in your diagnosis and simply need
        guidance and support, Mind Team [treatment
        services](/remote-neurodivergent-treatment/) are here to help.
    - question: What if you can’t diagnose me?
      answer: >-
        It’s completely possible (and normal) to be neurodivergent without
        meeting &nbsp;the DSM-5 requirements for a medical diagnosis.


        Ruling conditions out is still a vital step in the process and will help
        us get the information we need to successfully transition into the
        treatment phase. Treatment options can be effective in helping people
        with our without a narrowly-defined diagnosis.
