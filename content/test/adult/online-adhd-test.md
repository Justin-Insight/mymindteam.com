    Frequently asked <span class="underline underline--secondary">adult
    ADHD</span> testing questions
  questions:
    - question: Who will conduct my ADHD test?
      answer: >-
        You’ll be matched with the licensed Mind Team clinician who best fits
        your needs, like those on [our team](/our-team/) specializing in ADHD.
    - question: How long does adult ADHD testing take?
      answer: >-
        It depends. Mind Team remote ADHD tests are tailored to your unique
        history, background and concerns and vary in length. We’ll prepare you
        with what to expect before your test.
    - question: Do I need a referral to schedule my ADHD test?
      answer: >-
        No. Because Mind Team tests are paid out of pocket, you won’t need to
        obtain or wait for a referral to schedule your ADHD test.
    - question: What if I already have an ADHD diagnosis?
      answer: >-
        Mind Team ADHD tests can re-confirm or contest your prior ADHD
        diagnosis.


        If you are confident in your diagnosis and simply need guidance and
        support, Mind Team [treatment
        services](/remote-neurodivergent-treatment/) are here to help.
    - question: What if you can’t diagnose me with ADHD?
      answer: >-
        It’s completely possible (and normal) to struggle with attention,
        executive functioning and other neural aspects related to ADHD without
        meeting the full symptomatic requirements for an official diagnosis. 



        Ruling out ADHD is still a vital step in getting the answers and support
        you need to work <em>with</em> your unique mind, and Mind Team treatment
        services are here to help whether you have an official ADHD diagnosis or
        not.
