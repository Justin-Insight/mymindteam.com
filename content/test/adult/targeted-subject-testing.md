  questions:
    - question: Who will conduct my targeted subject test?
      answer: |-
        You’ll be matched with the licensed Mind Team clinician who best fits your needs based on your intake interview.
    - question: How long does adult targeted subject testing take?
      answer: |-
        Mind Team remote targeted subject tests are tailored to your unique history, background and concerns and vary in length. We’ll prepare you with what to expect before your test.
    - question: Do I need a referral to schedule my targeted subject test?
      answer: >-
        No. Because Mind Team tests are paid out of pocket, you won’t need to obtain or wait for a referral to schedule your test.
    - question: What if you can’t diagnose me with dyslexia, dysgraphia or dyscalculia?
      answer: |-
        It’s completely possible (and normal) to struggle with a specific subject without meeting the full symptomatic requirements for an official condition diagnosis. 


        Ruling out dyslexia, dysgraphia and/or dyscalculia is still a vital step in the process to get the answers and support you need to work <em>with your</em> unique mind. Mind Team treatment services can help, regardless of if you have an official condition diagnosis or not.
