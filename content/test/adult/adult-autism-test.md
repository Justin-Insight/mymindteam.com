      You may be struggling with autism and could benefit from a diagnosis if
      you:


      * Often get so hyper-focused on projects of interest that you lose track
      of time.

      * Have difficulty self-regulating while experiencing discomfort due to
      strong sounds, smells, textures and more.

      * Often rehearse conversations well in advance to avoid saying the “wrong”
      thing.

      * Experience difficulties and differences in understanding and engaging in
      social behavior.

      * Often feel like you’re wearing a mask or acting when around others.

    Frequently asked <span class="underline underline--secondary">adult autism
    testing</span> questions
  questions:
    - question: Who will conduct my autism assessment?
      answer: >-
        You’ll be matched with the licensed Mind Team clinician who best fits
        your needs, like those on [our team](/our-team/) specializing in autism.
    - question: How long does adult autism testing take?
      answer: >-
        It depends. Mind Team remote autism tests are tailored to your unique
        history, background and concerns, and vary in length. We’ll prepare you
        with what to expect before your test.
    - question: Do I need a referral to schedule my autism test?
      answer: >-
        No. Because Mind Team tests are paid out of pocket, you won’t need to
        obtain or wait for a referral to schedule your autism test.
    - question: What if you can’t diagnose me with autism?
      answer: >-
        It’s completely possible (and normal) to struggle with neural functions
        related to autism without meeting the full symptomatic requirements for
        an official condition diagnosis. 



        Ruling out autism is still a vital step in the process to get the
        answers and support you need to work <em>with</em> your unique mind, and
        Mind Team treatment services can help, regardless if you have an
        official autism diagnosis or not.
