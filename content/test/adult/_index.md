  questions:
    - question: Is Mind Team testing available in my state?
      answer: >-
        Mind Team services are available to individuals residing in PSYPACT
        states. See if you live in a qualifying state using <a
        href="https://psypact.site-ym.com/page/psypactmap" target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer nofollower">this coverage map</a>.
    - question: What if you don’t offer the test I’m looking for?
      answer: >-
        We may still be able to offer testing that addresses your concerns and
        answers the questions you have about your mind. Simply fill out our
        [brief questionnaire](/get-started/) to let us know what you’re looking
        for and we’ll help you find the solution that best suits your needs.
    - question: Do I have to pay in-full upfront?
      answer: >-
        No. Mind Team tests can be paid in three installments: $150 to schedule
        your intake interview, 50% of the remaining balance to schedule your
        test session, and a final payment of any remaining balance to schedule
        your post-assessment review.
    - question: How long does testing take?
      answer: >-
        It depends. Our tests typically range from one to five hours in length,
        depending on the type of test you need, as well as your personal
        history, input and other factors. 


        Once we’ve identified the best test for your needs, we’ll be able to
        give you a more accurate time estimate, as well as other important
        information about your test.
