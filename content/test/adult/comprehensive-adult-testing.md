  questions:
    - question: Who will conduct my comprehensive test?
      answer: |-
        You will be matched with the licensed Mind Team clinician who best fits your needs, according to the information you provide in your intake interview.
    - question: How long does comprehensive adult testing take?
      answer: |-
        Mind Team remote comprehensive tests are tailored to your unique history, background and concerns, and vary in length. We’ll prepare you with what to expect before your test.
    - question: Do I need a referral to schedule my test?
      answer: >-
        No. Because Mind Team tests are paid out of pocket, you won’t need to obtain or wait for a referral to schedule your comprehensive test.
    - question: What if you can’t diagnose me?
      answer: |-
        It’s completely possible (and normal) to struggle with key neural functions without meeting the full symptomatic requirements for an official condition diagnosis. 


        Ruling out various conditions is still a vital step in the process to get the answers and support you need to work <em>with</em> your unique mind, and Mind Team treatment services can help, regardless of whether or not you get an official diagnosis.
