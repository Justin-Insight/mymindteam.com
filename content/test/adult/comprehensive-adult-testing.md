    Frequently asked <span class="underline

  questions:
    - question: Who will conduct my comprehensive assessment?
      answer: >-
        You will be matched with the licensed [Mind Team clinician](/our-team/) who best fits
        your needs, according to the information you provide in your intake
        interview.
    - question: How long does comprehensive adult testing take?
      answer: >-
        It depends. Mind Team remote comprehensive tests are tailored to your
        unique history, background and concerns, and vary in length. We’ll
        prepare you with what to expect before your test.
    - question: Do I need a referral to schedule my test?
      answer: >-
        No. Because Mind Team tests are paid out of pocket, you won’t need to
        obtain or wait for a referral to schedule your comprehensive test.
    - question: What if you can’t diagnose me?
      answer: >-
        It’s completely possible (and normal) to struggle with key neural
        functions without meeting the full symptomatic requirements for an
        official condition diagnosis. 



        Ruling out various conditions is still a vital step in the process to
        get the answers and support you need to work <em>with</em> your unique
        mind, and Mind Team treatment services can help, regardless of whether
        or not you get an official diagnosis.
